ü´Å Lung Disease Detection using Deep Learning 
A CNN-based deep learning model trained to classify chest X-ray images into four categories: COVID-19, Viral Pneumonia, Bacterial Pneumonia, and Normal.

Key Highlights:

Achieved 82% accuracy on training data

Strong performance in COVID-19 class detection (Recall: 99%)

Explainability via SHAP and Grad-CAM

Model evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC

Dataset: Curated Kaggle X-ray dataset
Frameworks: TensorFlow/Keras, SHAP, OpenCV
Future Improvements: Address class imbalance, expand dataset, cross-validation
